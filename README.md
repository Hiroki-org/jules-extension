## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Command / Icon                      |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Set API Key**          | On first use, set your API key to connect to your Jules account. The key is stored securely in VSCode's SecretStorage and used automatically for all subsequent requests.                                          | `jules-extension.setApiKey`         |
| **Verify API Key**       | Test your API connection to ensure the key is valid and working.                                                                                                                                                   | `jules-extension.verifyApiKey`      |
| **GitHub Sign-in**       | Authenticate with GitHub using OAuth to allow Jules to interact with your repositories. This is the recommended and most secure method.                                                                          | `jules-extension.signInGitHub`      |
| **List Sources**         | Browse available data sources that Jules can work with.                                                                                                                                                            | `jules-extension.listSources`       |
| **Session Management**   | Use the `> Jules: Create Session` command to assign a new coding task to Jules. Past sessions are also listed, allowing you to resume work or review the history of completed tasks at any time.                   | `jules-extension.createSession`     |
| **Real-time Monitoring** | Get an at-a-glance view of Jules's current work status (`Running`, `Active`, `Done`, etc.) in a dedicated sidebar view. No more switching back and forth between your browser and editor.                          | `julesSessionsView`                 |
| **Progress Update**      | Curious about how far Jules has progressed? Click the `↻` (refresh) button to instantly fetch and display the latest session status and activity list.                                                             | `jules-extension.refreshSessions`   |
| **Activity Display**     | Select a session to view detailed logs of the commands Jules has executed, files it has edited, and its thought process. It provides a transparent development experience, as if you're peering into Jules's mind. | `jules-extension.showActivities`    |
| **Refresh Activities**   | Update the activities view for the current session to see the latest progress.                                                                                                                                     | `jules-extension.refreshActivities` |
| **Send Message**         | Send follow-up messages to an active Jules session to provide additional instructions or feedback.                                                                                                                 | `jules-extension.sendMessage`       |
| **Approve Plan**         | Review and approve plans generated by Jules before execution.                                                                                                                                                      | `jules-extension.approvePlan`       |
| **Open Settings**        | Quickly access the extension's settings directly from the sidebar view.                                                                                                                                            | `jules-extension.openSettings`      |
| **Delete Session**       | Remove a session from the local cache to clean up the session list.                                                                                                                                                | `jules-extension.deleteSession`     |
| **Clear Cache**          | Clear all cached Jules data, including sessions and credentials.                                                                                                                                                   | `jules-extension.clearCache`        |

## 📦 Installation

Install from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HirokiMukai.jules-extension)

Or search for "Jules Extension" in VS Code Extensions view.

### From Marketplace (Recommended)

1. Search for "Jules Extension" in the VSCode Marketplace
2. Click the `Install` button

### From VSIX File (Manual Install)

If you want to try the latest features that are not yet published on the Marketplace, you can download and install the `.vsix` file directly from the releases page.

1. **Go to the Releases Page:**
   Visit [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/jules-extension/releases) and find the latest release version.

2. **Download the VSIX File:**
   Download the `.vsix` file (e.g., `jules-extension-0.1.0.vsix`) from the `Assets`.

3. **Install in VSCode:**
   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the `Extensions` view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Click the `...` (More Actions) menu at the top of the view and select `Install from VSIX...`.
   - Select the downloaded `.vsix` file to install.

## 🔑 Getting Your API Key

To use the Jules Extension, you need a Jules API key. Follow these steps to get one:

1. **Create an Account:**

   - Go to the [Jules Official Website](https://jules.google/docs).
   - Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Generate API Key:**

   - Navigate to the "API Keys" or "Developer Settings" section in your account dashboard.
   - Click on "Create a new secret key".
   - Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "VSCode Extension") and generate it.

3. **Copy Your Key:**
   - Your new API key will be displayed. Copy it to your clipboard.
   - If you need to view your key again later, you can always find it on your Jules settings page.

> **Important:** Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control.

## Authentication

To allow Jules to interact with your repositories (e.g., to check the status of pull requests), you need to authenticate with GitHub.

### OAuth Sign-in (Recommended) ✅

This is the most secure and recommended method for authentication. It uses the official GitHub OAuth flow to grant access without needing to manually create and manage tokens.

**How to use:**

1.  Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
2.  Run the `Jules: Sign in to GitHub` command.
3.  You will be redirected to your browser to authorize the extension.

Once authorized, the token will be securely stored and used for all future interactions with GitHub.

---

### GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (Deprecated) ⚠️

**Using Personal Access Tokens (PAT) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.**

Please migrate to the OAuth sign-in method for better security and a smoother experience. If you have previously used a PAT, it will continue to work for now, but we strongly recommend switching.

## ⚙️ Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `jules-extension.apiKey`: Your Jules API key for authentication (stored securely).
- `jules-extension.autoRefresh.enabled`: Enable automatic refresh of the sessions list (default: `false`).
- `jules-extension.autoRefresh.interval`: Auto-refresh interval in seconds (default: `30`, minimum: `10`).
- `jules-extension.customPrompt`: A custom prompt to automatically prepend to every message sent to Jules. This acts as a persistent instruction (e.g., `Always reply in Japanese.`).
- `jules-extension.hideClosedPRSessions`: Automatically hide sessions with closed or merged pull requests from the session list (default: `true`).
- `jules.defaultBranch`: The default branch selection behavior when creating a Jules session (default: `current`). Can be `current`, `default`, or `main`.

### Deprecated Settings

- `jules-extension.githubToken`: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED.** Please use the `Jules: Sign in to GitHub` command instead.
- `jules.githubPat`: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED.** Please use the `Jules: Sign in to GitHub` command instead.

## Quick Start
