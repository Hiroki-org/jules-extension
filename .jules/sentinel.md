## 2024-05-24 - Add timeout to execFile to prevent DoS
**Vulnerability:** childProcess.execFile does not have a timeout, which can cause the extension host to hang indefinitely if the git process stalls.
**Learning:** External processes should always have a timeout to prevent DoS.
**Prevention:** Always add a timeout option when using childProcess.execFile or similar functions.
