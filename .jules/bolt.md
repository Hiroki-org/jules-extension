## 2024-05-01 - Avoid loop recreation of Sets
**Learning:** During review, we noticed `new Set([ ... ])` being instantiated inside a loop for activity logging in `extension.ts`. While it is just logging, moving static `Set` declarations out of repeated execution paths is a fundamental performance practice in V8.
**Action:** Move the activity log key `Set` declarations to module-level constants in `extension.ts` to prevent redundant garbage collection and allocation on hot code paths.

## 2025-02-23 - Avoid .map().filter() in Tooltip Rendering
**Learning:** Chained `.map().filter()` followed by `Array.from(new Map(...))` in UI rendering functions like `buildSessionTooltip` cause unnecessary array allocations and iterations, which can negatively impact performance when rendering large lists of sessions.
**Action:** Replace functional array chaining with direct single-pass `for` loops that populate the target collection (like a `Map`) directly when processing data for frequent UI rendering.

## 2024-05-12 - Replacing .sort() for array equality checks
**Learning:** Using `.sort()` followed by index-based iteration is a common, but slow O(N log N) way to determine multiset equality (when order doesn't matter). Replacing it with an O(N) Map lookup eliminates memory reallocation and algorithmic overhead.
**Action:** When comparing arrays where element order is independent (e.g. file paths or branch names), build a Map of element counts rather than `.sort()`.
